# Number-guessing-game-in-Java
As a part of my Java development internship at CognoRise Info Tech company, I managed to update an old number guessing game of mine by adding a GUI to the game using JavaFX.

## Overview of the project
A fully interactive number guessing game!ðŸŽ®</br>

Ever played a number guessing game? I took it a step further and built one in Java, incorporating key OOP principles for a more robust and user-friendly experience.</br>

Here's what I achieved:</br>

1- Object-Oriented Design: Utilized inheritance to create a clean and scalable codebase.</br>

2- Input Validation: Implemented robust checks to prevent invalid guesses and maintain game integrity.</br>

3- Exception Handling: Ensured a smooth gameplay experience by gracefully handling user input errors.</br>

4- User-Friendly Menu: Designed a clear and interactive menu for a seamless user experience.</br>

5- Smooth Graphical user interface made using JavaFX


This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application in building interactive programs.ðŸ’Ž
